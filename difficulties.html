            <h2>How cultures were treated differently</h2>
            <p>In the 1800's different cultures were in slavery which made it difficult for cultures to live normal lives. Abraham Lincoln played a part in ending slavery. After slavery ended there was still segregation and discrimination. There would be different rooms for different cultures. The rooms would be called "Whites" and "Colored." Schools would even have segregation. In the mid 1950's, the civil rights movement began which protested for equal rights and fair justice. Cultures were being treated differently because of the color of their skin. Multiple presidents attempted to form a law so cultures wouldn't be segregated. This law was then approved and cultures were able to be with others. Though people didn't agree with the law they had to follow it. Even today people are still discriminated against because of their race all around the world.<p>
