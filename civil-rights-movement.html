            <h1>Civil Rights Movement</h1>
            <h2>How this movement changed the governments perspective</h2>
            <p>This movement protested against cultures being discriminated against and segregated from others. In the mid 1950's, the civil rights movement spread awareness on how people were segregated by "race". The civil rights movement began in 1954 and lasted until 1968. Many people contributed to helping in the civil rights movement. Some of these people are Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, and John Lewis. Martin was famous for his peaceful protests, Rosa refused to get out of her seat and give it to an American, and John was a civil rights leader and a politician who helped organize the March on Washington.</p>
