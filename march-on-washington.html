            <p>The March on Washington was held on August 28, 1963 at Washington D.C. It was attended by 250,000 people protesting. It had six popular collaborators which included James Farmer, Martin Luther King Jr, John Lewis, A. Phillip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young which were all leaders of civil right groups. The main leader was Bayard Rustin, who was an activist. The event was held to demand equality, fair justice, and freedom for every citizen. This event had musical performances and speeches. It also had tributes to every African American woman included in the Civil Rights Movement. At the march, there was multiple speakers and the last speaker helped people support the movement even more.
