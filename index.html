            <h2>Why we built this website</h2>
            <p>We built this website to help spread awareness. This website has multiple pages and is very informative. This site includes videos and pictures to view. We want to share to others how racism can affect many people and different cultures. Many people all around the world have been dealing with racism for years. We want to help people understand how racism affects everyone and not just one culture. Our website is interactive and gives facts on the civil rights movement or other events. We chose a website as our prototype because we can expand our site to others.</p>
